# Computer Graphics Project: Museum

## Overview

This project is an OpenGL application developed in C++ as part of the Computer Graphics course at Poznan University of Technology. It simulates a virtual museum environment, allowing users to navigate through a two-room building designed in Blender and exported as an `.obj` file.

## Features

- **3D Navigation**:
  - Move through the virtual museum using keyboard controls.
  - Adjust the camera perspective with mouse movements.

- **Interactive Environment**:
  - Explore a two-room building complete with windows, providing an immersive experience.

## Controls

- **Movement**:
  - `W` - Move forward
  - `A` - Move left
  - `S` - Move backward
  - `D` - Move right

- **Camera**:
  - Move the mouse to adjust the camera's direction.

- **Exit**:
  - Press `Alt + F4` to exit the application.

## Installation and Running the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zecozejak/Computer-Graphics-Project-Museum.git
   cd Computer-Graphics-Project-Museum
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:

   - Ensure you have a C++ development environment set up with OpenGL libraries installed.
   - Compile the source code using your preferred C++ compiler.

3. **Run the Application**:

   - Execute the compiled binary to start the virtual museum experience.
